# 3D-Platform-V-0.3
Simple 3D Mario-like game.

feel free to download
i have no idea how to use github so this is the game, and when i figure out how to upload the code i will. (if anyone knows please let me know!)

this game was made in C# on Unity
Using the Zenva.com course as a frame and building off of that!
